Q1) The topic finalised is fitness excercises for the elderly to perform. These include a range of resistance training excercises eg bench press, leg press machine stability excercises eg excercises on a Bosu balance trainer and cardio health eg treadmill walking.

Q2) The data sources I have found are lower strength training excercises to improve balance and leg strength of elderly and resistance training excercises to improve the muscular fitness of the elderly.
